# VERY MUCH UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This will be a stack-based language where code is defined by the variation in text from one line to the next: reversing, rotating, or extending the words will each represent a different command.

The catch: only block drawing characters are recognized. Also, the interpreter hates boring code and will not process programs that lack visual interest.

# VARIATIONS (this will change)

* **MOTIF** = original (ESTABLISH MOTIF, SET NEW MOTIF)
* **PUSH** (add the new things to the stack) = original with more at end (new things at the end)
* **EMIT** = reverse
* **MUL** = extend all
* **DIV** = shorten all (except 1s)
* **SWAP / ROT** (number of items determined by how many rotations in the code) = cycle (begin with a different one and wrap)
* **ADD** = double one word
* **SUB** = double two-word phrase
* **DROP** = missing last word
* **DUP** = whole thing twice
* **PUSH** (from Input) = original with something new (different size from first item) in front

any block with three or more characters is a variable
other blocks have no particular meaning
